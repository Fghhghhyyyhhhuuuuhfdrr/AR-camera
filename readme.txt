Submitted By: Pulkit Saharan and Shivani Naik

1. URL of Wiki Page - https://wiki.khoury.northeastern.edu/display/~shivaninaik/Project+4%3A+Calibration+and+Augmented+Reality

2. Operating System - Windows and macOS

3. IDE - Visual Studio and xcode

4. To run the program- Need main.cpp, calibrate.cpp, calibrate.hpp, ObjectParser.cpp, ObjectParser.hpp, .obj file. 
Open them in an IDE and run the program after adding necessary opencv library files.

Command line argument:
obj_path :  path to wavefront obj file

7. Key Presses:
's' - save the current frame for calibration and calibrate using calibration images
'e' - show extracted corners for a calibration image
'd' - Detect the pattern and draw axes
'h' - Project chair on the target
'b' - Project cube on the target
't' - project table on the target
'p' - overlays an image on the ArUco markers
'r' - Detect and extract the matching ORB features between two images
'3' - Project 3D obj file object
'a' - detect ArUco markers
'7' - detect and display Harris corners

8. The extensions we have created are also in the above mentioned files and can be executed through same files.
